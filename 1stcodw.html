  </h2>

     <h4>  HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 
       was not released officially, published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.<br>
             <!--   <b>   that is cold bold tag that tag is use to blod the line -->
             <!--   <i>   that is cold i tagor ittalic tag taht tag use to convart any text style to ittalic-->

            <i>HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient</i>
            <em>emtag = i tag that both is similar but name is deferent</em>
            <!--<em>emtag = i tag that both is similar but name is deferent</em>-->
    </h4> 

    <h3>
        HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites.<small> So the language was also not growing.</small> 
            <!--<small> this tag is cold small tag</small>-->
